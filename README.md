# Neural Networks - Help Desk Ticketing System

This project involves the onstruction and use an artificial neural network applied in a help desk ticketing system. For the requirements of the assignment I’ve used the Python programming language and the scikit-learn library.

## Installation and Usage

I have provided a virtual environment, venv, as well as a requirements.txt file in my submission to make setting up the program possible with the following commands:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
At this point, the virtual environment is activated, and the program’s dependencies should be installed. In order to run the program, use the following command:

```bash
python3 A4main.py <Bas|Int|Adv>
```
